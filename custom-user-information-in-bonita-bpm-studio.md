# 1.9.4 Custom user information in Bonita BPM Studio

You can use custom user information to assign task to users based on information that is specific to your organization and not included in the standard organization definition. 
You define the attributes that you want to store, and then add the values for the users.

### 

Example usecases

Some example use cases for custom information are to create a security badge with an individual value (number) for each user, an office skill for a user, a special professional activity, or geographical details. All these types of information are not displayed in standard information tabs.


## 

List of users

By default, in the Organization menu \> Manage organizations \> Organization users \> **List of users**, four tabs contain standard information about a user in the Organization:

* General (Title, First and last name, Job title)
* Membership (Group/role)
* Personal (Email, phone, website, address etc.)
* Business card (Email, phone, website, address etc.)



### 

Custom tab

A tab called **Custom**, has been added to the four default tabs.

When a user is selected in the **List of users**, the custom information for each user is displayed in the **Custom** tab. If a custom user information is added for one user, it is applied to all users in the organization.

This custom user information is also displayed in the **User information management** tab.

When the **Custom tab** is clicked, the **configuration name** (applied to all users) and a **value** (applied only to a single user), are displayed in the panel.

A link called **Manage custom information**, is displayed in the Custom tab, which takes the user straight to the **User information management tab**.

This information can be modified using the edit button.


## 

User information management

A tab called **User information management** displays a pane with both the default and custom information for a user.

**Custom information** (editable) is displayed on the right hand side of the pane. Two buttons, **add** and **delete** allow the edition of custom information in the Custom pane.



## 

New actor filter category

An actor filter category called **Organization** has been added. It contains an actor filter called **Users with Custom information**.

The actor filter can be added to actor for a lane or a task (not a pool).

A task is assigned to an actor. An actor is mapped to a list of users. This filter is applied to the set of users mapped to the actor. When the filter is applied, each user which has not added custom information (a value) to their user description (custom tab) will be filtered out. They will not be eligible to perform the task.



## 

Actor filter value

An actor filter definition must have a value is order to make the filter work. This value is used on the actor filter. 
For example, a filter could be defined as a language. The value for the filter could be French, or English etc.
An actor has users mapped to it, who can perform a task.
When custom user information is added to a user, the actor filter will use the value contained in the definition to select users who posses this value in the custom user information tab.
This enables certain users to be mapped to a given task. When the process is run, the user will be automatically assigned to the task.

A link called **Manage custom information**, is displayed in the Custom tab, which links directly to the User information management tab.


## 

Assign tasks automatically

Check the checkbox to apply this feature. This feature is only applied when there is one user assigned to a task.
