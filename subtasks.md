# 3.3.4 Subtasks

It is possible for a user to add a subtask to a task. Typically, you use a subtask to track an external or off-line activity that must be completed before you can complete a task.


To define a subtask:

1. Go to **Tasks**.
2. Click **To do**.
3. Select a task.
4. Click _**Add subtask**_.
5. Assign the subtask to a user.
6. Click _**Add**_. The subtask is displayed in the To do filter.
