# 1.7.3 6.x legacy forms
[Use 6.x forms](#useLegacyForms)  
[Hide/Show 6.x specific features](#hideShowLegacy)



## Use 6.x forms


From the **Execution** tab, in the **Form**, **Instantiation form**, and **Overview page** panes, you can choose 6.x option. 
This enables you to continue to use the 6.x forms.
The configuration is for each forms or pages, not global.
This means that a process can have a mix of 6.x and 7.x forms/pages to make it easier to [migrate forms from 6.x](/migrate-form-6x).


## Hide/Show 6.x specific features


When you no longer need access to the 6.x features, you can hide them to simplify the Bonita BPM Studio UI.

1. Go to **Preferences**.
2. In the **Other** category, click **6.x legacy**.
3. Uncheck the checkbox to hide some 6.x only features.
