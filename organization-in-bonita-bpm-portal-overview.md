# 3.7 Organization in Portal overview



In Bonita BPM Portal, a user with the Administrator profile active can view all the parts of an organization including:

* the parent groups
* child groups 
* the number and list of users in a group
* the manager of each user
* the email address of a user 
* the date and time of the user's last login
* the roles created and the number of users with that role

The Administrator has the right to:

* [import an organization exported from Bonita BPM Studio](/importexport-organization-1)
* [export an organization from Bonita BPM Portal](/importexport-organization-1)
* [create and delete groups](/manage-group-1)
* [create and delete roles](/manage-role-0)
* [create and manage users](/manage-user-0) and manage memberships

**Developer environment:** When you are testing a process locally by running it from Bonita BPM Studio, the default organization defined in the Studio is **automatically published** to the Bonita BPM Portal.


**Production environment:** When you first launch Bonita BPM Portal in a Production environment, there is **no default organization**. 
You must [create a user with the Administrator profile](/first-steps-after-setup-1#create_admin). This user can than create and manage the organization.
