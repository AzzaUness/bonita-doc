## activityVariable

### Description

This resource enables you to retrieve the value of a specific variable name for a specific case (or process instance). Only persistent variables are concerned by this resource, not transient variables.

### Identifier

The ID of the activity variable (a long value).

### Representation

    { 
    "tenantId": "_The ID of the tenant where the current user is logged in (technical information)_",
    "tenantId_string": "_number (since 7.0.1)_",
    "id":_The identifier of the variable_",
    "id_string":"_number (since 7.0.1)_",
    "name": "_The name of the activity variable_",
    "description": "_The description of the variable, if any_",
    "transientData": "FALSE" _Always false (boolean)_",
    "className": "_The fully qualified class name of the variable type_",
    "containerId": "_The ID of the activity containing this variable (same as the one passed as parameter) if the variable is defined at activity level, or ID of the process instance if the variable is defined on the process_",
    "containerId_string": _"number" (since 7.0.1)_,
    "containerType": "ACTIVITY_INSTANCE" | "PROCESS_INSTANCE" _depending on whether the variable is defined at activity or process level._",
    "value": "_the value of this variable. The format of the value depends on the type of the variable_" 
    }
    

The string representation added in 7.0.1 for Long attributes is a workaround for the JavaScript integer spectrum issue.
