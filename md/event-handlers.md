4.7.2 Event handlers
====================

An event handler is an extension to the engine that is configured to run when a specified event occurs. You can add event handlers for several purposes and you can configure which events you want to catch.
We strongly recommend that you add only appropriate handlers and carefully code the handler filters to handle only those events that you are interested in.

[Add an event handler](#add)
[Register an event handler](#register)
[Example](#example)
[Registration](#registration)
[Event handler source code](#code)
[Event list](#list)
An event is a change to any object in the database (user, activity, processDefinition,... ). You can create an event handler to track any change to any object in the database and take the appropriate action. For example:

-   Catch PROCESSINSTANCE\_CREATED to detect that a process instance has started, and notify the process supervisor.
-   Catch FLOWNODE\_INSTANCE\_CREATED to detect that a human task is available, and send email to all the users elligible to perform it.
-   Catch HIDDEN\_TASK\_CREATED to detect that a service task becomes available, and start an external system that is required to complete the task.

At the end of this page there is a [list of all the events](#list).

Add an event handler {#add}
--------------------

An event handler is added to the system as a jar file and made available using a classloader.\
(e.g. placing jar file under /WEB-INF/lib folder of the web application)

An event handler contains a filter, `isInterested`, which detects the relevant instances of the event.
The [example](#code) below shows how to use the State Id of a flow node to filter for a particular state (in this case, failed).
Flownode State Ids are defined in the subclasses of `org.bonitasoft.engine.core.process.instance.api.states.FlowNodeState`.
There is no exhaustive list; the set of states is extensible without notice.

Event handlers are recursive, that is, if an event handler itself modifies something and triggers an event, the relevant event handler is called. This means you might need to include loop detection in your event handler.

Register an event handler {#register}
-------------------------

An event handler is registered on an event by adding an entry to the appropriate map.
The list of handlers registered at platform level can be extended in the `BONITA_HOME/engine-server/conf/platform/bonita-platform-sp-custom.xml` file.
Theist of handlers registered at tenant level can be extended in the `BONITA_HOME/engine-server/conf/tenants/TENANT_ID/bonita-tenant-sp-custom.xml` file.

Each entry in the map is a key-value pair, which specifies the event handler to be called for each event.
The isInterested filter in the event handler detects the relevant instances of the event and calls the event handler.
You cannot have more than one handler for a given event, but you can use the isInterested filter to specify different actions for different instances of the event.

Example
-------

This example shows an event handler that detects changes in the state of activity instances. If an activity has moved into Failed state, the event handler calls [DelayedRetry](/technical-logger-service-0#delayedretry).
