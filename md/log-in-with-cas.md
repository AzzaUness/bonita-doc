4.5.7 Log in with CAS
=====================

Depending on your underlying authentication service, you may need to provide other information with the API in order to log in. A login method with a map enables you to provide the set of credentials that the authentication service requires.
The following example can be used if you are [using Bonita BPM with CAS](/single-sign-cas-0):

` final LoginAPI loginAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getLoginAPI(); final Map credentials = new HashMap(); credentials.put(AuthenticationConstants.CAS_TICKET, ticket); APISession session = loginAPI.login(credentials); ProcessAPI processAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getProcessAPI(session);`{type="java"}
