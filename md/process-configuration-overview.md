1.12 Process configuration overview
===================================

There are two reasons for configuring a process:

-   Configuring a process for testing
-   Configuring a process before deployment

Before you can run a process from Bonita BPM Studio for testing, you must configure it. The configuration is partly set implicitly by the Deployment and Web
preferences set as [Bonita BPM Studio preferences](/bonita-bpm-studio-preferences-0) and is partly set explicitly by
[configuring the process using the configuration wizard](/configuring-process-bonita-bpm-studio-0).

Before you export a process for deployment, you need to set the initial configuration [using the configuration wizard](/configuring-process-bonita-bpm-studio-0).
This configuration is exported with the process if you check the Configuration option in the export dialog when you
[build a .bar archive](/import-and-export-process-1#build_for_deployment).
If you are using the Performance edition, you can [update the configuration after deployment](/processes-0).
For other editions, you can modify the actor mapping only.
