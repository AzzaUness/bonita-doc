## What is the purpose of the Bonita BPM Deploy bundle?




* The Bonita BPM Deploy bundle is used if you have **already installed a JEE Application Server**.
* The Bonita BPM Deploy bundle is a way of setting up a Bonita BPM Platform. You'll be able to get a setup quite similar to JBoss or Tomcat bundle.
* It's also used to package other tools such as the LDAP synchronizer.

## Deploy bundle content



* `BonitaBPMSubscription-`_`version`_`-LDAP-Synchronizer`: the LDAP Synchronizer (Subscription editions only).
* `Jboss-`_`version`_: a folder/file structure to be merged with an existing setup of JBoss in order to install Bonita BPM Portal and Bonita BPM Engine.
* `License`: license files that apply to Bonita components.
* `Request_key_utils-6.0`: include script files to generate license request keys.
* `Tomcat-`_`version`_: a folder/file structure to be merged with an existing setup of Apache Tomcat, in order to install Bonita BPM Portal and Bonita BPM Engine.
* `README.TXT`: contains the detailed contents and structure of the `deploy.zip`.

Note: the JBoss directory contains Tomcat `.jar` files which refer to `bonita-tomcat-h2-listener-`_`version`_.jar and `bonita-tomcat-valve-`_`version`_.jar.
As JBoss embeds Tomcat as a Servlet engine, these libraries are delivered both for Tomcat and JBoss.




## Installation



1. Download the deploy.zip file from the [Bonitasoft download page](http://www.bonitasoft.com/how-we-do-it/downloads) for the Community edition 
or from the [Customer Portal](https://customer.bonitasoft.com/download/request) for Subscription editions.

2. Unzip the `deploy.zip` into a temporary folder.
3. Install Bonita BPM in your Application Server, by merging the appropriate folder (e.g. `Jboss-7.1.1.Final` or `Tomcat-7.0.55`) from `BonitaBPMSubscription-6.x.y-deploy` folder 
into the existing root folder of your application server.

4. If you do not want to use the h2 database, you need to specify the [database configuration](/database-configuration-2). The h2 database is not suitable for a production environment.

## License installation



If you are installing a Subscription edition, you need to [request a license](/licenses-1). 


When you receive your license, copy the file to the `var_bh_code_replace/server/licenses` folder of your application server.


## Edition specification


If you are installing the Performance Subscription edition, 
you need to edit `engine-server/conf/platform-init/bonita-platform-init-community-custom.properties` 
and change the value of the `activeProfiles` key to `'community,performance'`. No change is needed for the Community, Teamwork, or Efficiency edition.



## Next steps



When you have finished installing the deploy bundle, [complete the setup](/first-steps-after-setup-1) of your system by validating the installation, setting passwords, and creating the Administrator user.
